*On Saving People
[Relevant song](https://youtu.be/3fCdZzsP4U0)

A major theme in my life right now seems to be stepping back from helping people. This is my favorite verse in the song:

I don't wanna love you if won't receive it

I don't wanna save the world that way

I don't wanna be your personal Jesus

I don't wanna play your video game

I don't wanna put the devil on a pedestal

I don't wanna put the saints in chains

I just wanna make my life a little easier

I don't wanna play your video game  

I do the highlighted things automatically, equating "how can I solve the problems of those around me," to loving them. In many ways, this is true, but contains some subtle long-term issues. As this verse progresses, it describes the hole that approach can put you into. In general, it rejects the approach, describing it generally as "being your personal jesus", to which I interpret as "saving people from their mistakes and solving their problems for them." It next equates the approach as "saving the world," a trite phrase many of us were brought up to try for. The crux of the failure of this approach is that it denies agency to the saved - it treats the world and the target of the song as manipulable, like a video game to be won. He pushes it further - if this approach is the path of righteousness, that "chains" those following Jesus/the Path (saints) to the success of something outside their control - the success and personal choices of the people around them. The approach subtly wags the dog, and gives the devil too much power. It's also ultimately an exercise in futility - people must embrace Jesus themselves - we can't make them drink. While "make my life a little easier" seems like a selfish thing to say, I think it's said so ironically and reflects the truth that this approach is too hard for people to do - we weren't meant to.  

The biggest gap I wish he covered is the deep disrespect that this approach communicates to the "saved". By trying to help, we communicate that they need the help, that the risk of their failure is unacceptable.
