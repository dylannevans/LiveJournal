# On priorities

## God’s educational strategy

God has priorities; he says some truths are more important than others. This is well-supported by unambiguous scripture: A tricky lawyer once asked Jesus about God’s priorities for us, and the answer was so well-known that the lawyer already knew the right answer: “Love the Lord your God with all your heart and all your soul and all your mind.” And the second is like it, “Love your neighbor as yourself.”

If you still think that’s a one-off, you can do word and theme studies, even weight them by red letters or testament. You will find that not all topics get equal time. Example: God spends a lot more on the continued unfaithfulness of Israel than the ephahs of flour required for a guilt or sin offering.

## It’s not like he doesn’t know stuff

God knows many truths. He knows how long your left big toenail was when you woke up on your 11th birthday. He knows all the names of the people who died in the Holocaust. God knows so much more than any of us could ever contain in our little brains. Those are all truths, and he doesn’t talk about any of them.

He could tell us truths, too. He could have explained the principals of planetary orbits, plastid recombination, or electron tunnelling to every person in the world long before they were painstakingly discovered by regular people. He could live-translate Simpsons episodes into fluent Latin, Aramaic, or early Han Chinese. He could answer questions today – what will happen if the earth’s temperature rises 5 degrees over the next 15 years? Will we have a nuclear war in our lifetime? Will accommodating extra demands get me that promotion at work? If I resist, will I get fired?

## So why doesn’t he?

God has told us a lot of stuff, and the details about the shape and mechanics of the world we live in are incidental. The plain conclusion of this omission is that this sort of content is not very important to God.

It is tempting to misinterpret God’s silence on the details of our world. Some try so hard to ignore God’s clear priorities, and filter through the Bible for the few incidental indications of shape: the literal age of the world, the origin and mechanics of life, the [properties of deep-sea creatures](https://answersingenesis.org/dinosaurs/drawing-out-biblical-leviathan/), and the mechanics of [sea-splitting](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/12/08/no-really-there-is-a-scientific-explanation-for-the-parting-of-the-red-sea-in-exodus/).

Some even interpret God’s silence on the shape of our world as a flat denial of its nature. They say that because God chose not to write in a physics primer into the Bible means that magnetism itself is an unknowable mystery and therefore forbidden from study.

Some try for legalism, assembling all the concrete commandments they can find into a long checklist and judging themselves and each other through successful completion. In this way, they use the Bible as a shield from the stark reality of their sin and failure in spirit. “Paul told me to pray,” implicitly becomes, “God requires us only to pray,” ignoring [Isaiah](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=isaiah+29%3A13&version=NIV) and [Jesus’s](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+6%3A5-8&version=NIV) consistent admonishments against posting “thoughts and prayers” on twitter and facebook.

## What God does find important

Consider what God *has* said to us. The bible focuses on our relationship with God and our relationship with each other. Over and over God Israel forsake God – Gideon and Isaiah and Ezekiel and Paul tell an ironclad story of their failure to uphold their covenant. That failure is a relational failure. People are evil, enslaved to sin even in ways they cannot perceive. That is a relational failure.

**The common theme in God’s every message is relational.** How we perceive, relate to, and treat each other and God is the most important thing to Him. Sin is disrespecting God, and evil is malice and selfishness. Righteousness is truth and grace, and goodness is mercy and thankfulness. All these traits describe relationships. [As Jesus said](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+15%3A1-20&version=NIV), “But the things that come out of a person’s mouth come from the heart, and these defile them. For out of the heart come evil thoughts … these are what defile a person...” It is not the shape of the world that God wants us to care about, it is each other and him.

## Does the world matter?

Some say that science is against God, usually because science (careful observation of the shape and mechanics of the world) conflicts with some incidental detail in a biblical narrative focused on a relational truth. Consider: if you ignore the lesson in Genesis 3 about how disrespecting and lying to God leads to death and pain, and ignore the repeated lesson in Genesis 4 about the same, and ignore the repeated lesson in Genesis 5-8 about the same, and ignore the lesson about God’s enduring grace in Genesis 9, and ignore every important lesson in the bible, and instead just write down all the people listed in the lineages, guess their age when they had the next son, and add up those numbers, you will get a total that ostensibly could be the number of years from Adam to Jesus. If you add 2000+ years and 7 days, you get the amount of time from when God created the universe to today, and therefore the total age of the universe. Then, because the Bible is True, you conclude that the age of the universe is about 6000 years old.

This misread spits in the face of God. The point of Genesis 5-8 is not that Noah was 500 when Shem was born – it was a lesson about how Original Sin had cascaded and reflected through all people, poisoning their hearts against God. It sets up Noah as an echo of Adam, condemned to continue the cycle of failure through his kids. It sets up Noah as a foreshadowing of Abraham, a weird loner ridiculed for being the one person to follow God. It establishes a pattern of Noah’s maverick trust in God over the “wisdom” of people, echoed by every prophet since. It establishes a precedent for God’s deep anger at our collective idiocy, yet also establishes precedent for his mercy and grace even knowing that our continued stupidity and sin is guaranteed.

This story would be just as powerful and relevant and illuminating about our relation to God and each other if Noah was actually 36 and Shem’s name was Wulfgang. Focusing on the shape and details incidental to the message is a waste of time and disrespectful to God.

Imagine if God did decide to include all the details of the formation of the world up through people: That the formation of the Sun out of an amorphous nebula took billions of years, that the earth took another billion, then seas took 700 million years to take shape, then it took another several billion for plants to show up, and animals, then different kinds of animals, then people. Consider the narrative if God included that level of detail: archaea, eukaryotes, sponges, the major strains of photosynthetic bacteria, the formation of the oxygenic atmosphere, continental drift, the Great Dyings, the angiosperms, mammals, ice ages, and all the other interesting events over billions of years. That narrative would have distracted readers from the point: God’s intent and vision, the resulting goodness of the world, and how that should affect our relationship with Him. A poetic summary across 7 metaphorical days in roughly the same order is wildly more effective for God’s purposes.

Science is not against God. The world is a holy place, and carefully observing it can be rewarding and a way to respect and honor God. Some righteousness can even result: knowledge of fertilizers and how to make them have made agriculture so productive that starvation only occurs because of war. Learning about the world has made it easier to “feed my sheep.”

At the same time, science is not God’s top priority for us. He calls us to empathetic, generous, loving hearts. “Go, and do likewise.” The Bible is clear: the relationships are what God wants us to focus on.

## What about all the stuff?

Most of our time and effort is spent on God-adjacent activities like science. Work and school and making dinner and doing errands and arguing with the insurance company and driving to soccer games and paying bills and gardening and hobbies and watching TV are not God’s focus for us, but they do have value.

Yet: God calls us to those activities, to work, explore, and learn in areas other than his top priorities. Somehow, the operations of life are a necessary vehicle for his purpose. They are the shape of our worlds, and God works inside and through them, not in opposition. Sometimes, God’s direction for our life is even operational, “pick up that pot, and put it over there.” Somehow, spiritually growth occurs because and through our activities. We choose how to respond, potentially by following God to grow more generous, gracious, and patient.

This has been true forever. So many psalms describe someone’s frustrations with the shape of their world: invading armies, starvation, and loss. Most of the Old Testament delivers its themes via stories about real people with real lives. They ate, travelled, farmed, got eaten by whales, and sat under trees. Jesus’ lessons were about regular people doing regular things: servants and vineyards and farming and sheep. People have always found spiritual truths to be more accessible through the medium of daily life than a direct exhortation.

## So…what?

Sometimes God’s directives seem in conflict. Consider: perhaps someone you know is gay. Do you:

-   Deny them love and respect and social membership as an incentive for them to renounce their gayness, which Leviticus and Paul have said is wrong.
-   Love them, remind them of their great value in Christ, encourage and inspire them to grow in grace and mercy?

This is the power of priorities. God’s call to love him and each other is unambiguously more important to him than anything else. It wins. If you’re not loving, you’re failing God. God has taken responsibility for providing the incentives for right behavior and has clearly said that taking them into our own hands is unhelpful and sinful.

It can get a little more complicated if the conflict is between two other directives – is it more right to give money to a homeless shelter or go to a benefit gala for an adoption agency? One seems more righteous, but not as obviously as the previous example. Biblical study often clarifies God’s priorities, especially within Paul’s letters, which were written to explain and correct common misconceptions in the early church. In this case, there is some solid rhetoric from the Man Himself [cautioning against](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+6&version=NIV) public displays of virtue, because it can poison your motives. God cares more about your motives (because they are relational) than the tangible outcomes (because they are about the shape of the world). If God’s top priority was that the animal shelter had more money, he’d just do it. He wants you to give the money because that grows you.
