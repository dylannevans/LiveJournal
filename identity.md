## Identity property of Sin
The following can be reframed as each other:
 - Sin: apartness from God
 - Idolatry: putting your worth in something that’s not God.
 - Telling yourself a lie: about God, your nature, or God’s assignments for you or others.  
 - Failing God: being involved in an outcome displeasing to God. Failing: a non-ideal outcome

## Crazy Idea #38: Election isn’t superiority
either morally or in value.  
Consider who Jesus sought: the pathetic, the stupid, the sinful.  He made this explicit with the sermon on the mount. Consider the story of the lost lamb, and the commensurate rejoicing in heaven.  Consider Paul's quote about his perfection to the law a loss. God does not love the righteous more.  
Jesus indicates no correlation between those he calls and God's love.  There was nothing special about his apostles, just as Moses wasn't that amazing, and the only amazing thing about Abraham was his trust. 
We know that some people feel God's voice and actions louder and heavier than others.  Many do not see God at all. God must be choosing who to speak to.  
Paradoxically, the people that seem to be most aware of God are those that have the biggest problems, the ones to whom his instructions seem most difficult.  Oddly, pain and frustration and evil are the best reminders of God: You don't know what you got till it's gone and [No one's laughing at God when they're starving or freezing or so very poor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pxRXP3w-sQ).

So when you next see someone lying in the gutter, don't pity them. Yes, their body is uncomfortable and their priorities are frustrated and they are all out of hope.  But bodies are dumb anyway and we aren't great at setting priorities and we don't know what to hope for.  Well, maybe pity them a little, but also envy them for the clarity and opportunity God's given them. Theirs is the kingdom of heaven; you're seeing his election in front of your face, and it's God's choice alone to grant it to them.  Their life choices and relative righteousness have nothing to do with His gift, and you've got a lot of nerve second-guessing His decision.  You fail too, and hard enough that the difference between their sin and yours would not pass a T test.  

Pity the rich person, who [needs nothing and invents problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_Limbaugh).  Pity the fool who [collects seashells](https://www.desiringgod.org/books/dont-waste-your-life) to pass their later years. Pity the person who hasn't been confronted with their need of God. 

Even if you're born rich and privileged, God calls you to be your most beautiful self, and not in a Kardashians way.  There's fruit to bear and lessons to learn and wisdom to gain.  Don't spend all your time picking flowers just because you started life on easy mode: go do some hard and beautiful things.
