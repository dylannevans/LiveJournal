Needs to be expanded introducing principles. Notes for now:

Whys and Hows are always much more challenging than Whats. Consider a fat person. They may say, "I will lose weight this year." That is a What. If they do not also identify a strong Why driving it, this resolution is just dust in the wind or a seedling in the rocks: they are not invested and it will disappear at the first challenge. Many Whys are possible: 
 - "I want to be able to participate in activities with my family."
 - "I want to avoid diabetes."
 - "I recognize that God has made my body holy and beautiful, and I want to honor his work and investment."
 - "I want less physical pain in my life."
 - "My spouse communicates that I am less valuable or virtuous because of my weight. I want them to value me, so I will change myself to match their desires."

Without good Whys, this person will perform the What only as long as it's easy or they have nothing better to do.

Even if they have a Why important to them, it only becomes real if they figure out Hows. Success is 90% execution: identifying and doing their next right step.
