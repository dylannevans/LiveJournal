## FAQ

  - Excellent resiliency. It's gonna take the end of the world to knock github over.
- Why is this public? 
  - Meet the spirit of AA: do not go gentle into the temptation to front a narrative that you are basically fine. I am not fine. I need help. I cannot be who I want to be without assistance.
     - Bonus: My vulnerability extends safety to others to admit that they are not fine.
  - The only way to consistently guard against the temptation to hide your <flaws|failures|sins|bad habits|suck> is to be open about them. While confession works great, this LJ is an exploration of radical confessionism: telling the world about my suck is the most binding way to avoid that trap.
  - A humble declaration of faith, accessible from my professional platforms but not distractingly so.
