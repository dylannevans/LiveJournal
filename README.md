# Dylan's LiveJournal

A collection of thoughts reflecting my own personal growth. Some are more mature than others, and none are complete.  Strong Opinions, Held Weakly. 

I'd love to hear your thoughts; feel free to comment via issues or discussions.

## FAQ
- Why git?
  - Because I want to to reflect my current state without losing the journey to get there.
  - I need to be able to record other perspectives, dissent, and collaboration from my partners in this journey. The Issues and Discussions features are a good fit for this.
  - Excellent resiliency. It's gonna take the end of the world to knock github over.
- Why is this public? 
  - Meet the spirit of AA: do not go gentle into the temptation to front a narrative that you are basically fine. I am not fine. [I need help](https://saltyonsecurity.net/help-personal/). I cannot be who I want to be or do what I want to do without assistance from God and my neighbors, however inconveniently that assistance is rendered.
     - Bonus: My vulnerability extends safety to others to admit that they are not fine.
  - The only way to consistently guard against the temptation to hide your <flaws|failures|sins|bad habits|suck> is to be open about them. While confession works great, this LJ is an exploration of radical confessionism: telling the world about my suck is the most binding way to avoid that trap.
  - A humble declaration of faith, accessible from my professional platforms but not distractingly so.

At the time of writing this disclosure, LiveJournal was a trademark of some iffy Russian holding company of has-been internet properties. I use the term generically to convey the spirit in which it is written - an authentic, perhaps oversharing invitation to an indeterminate number of strangers to engage and speak into my life, reflective of its mid-aughts gestalt.
