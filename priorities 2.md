I noticed that I become most angry when people

-   condescend to me.
-   Contradicts me with no explanation.
-   are disrespectful to me.
-   lie to me. 

When these situations occur, my default reaction is to have a conversation with the speaker about their perspective and mine.

Why?

# The Assumptions

I believe most people who identify with the first component believe it is a universal human trait. It meshes well with narratives from psychology, religion, and history. Definitionally, insults damage someone’s self-perception of value, and our culture has many examples of how cultures have found them justifiable grounds for war or aggression. Most “best practices” promoted by psychology works to reduce the likelihood that the listener will mistake a statement for an insult. For instance, I statements, open-ended questions, and NVC.

The second is similar. The people who follow it think it a universal trait, but because there are enough people who don't match, need an explanation for those outliers. The most common explanation is some combination of stupid, damaged, or unskilled at expressing their emotions; "if those people thought hard enough about it or went to enough therapy, they would also learn that the right approach to conflict is to unpack it." the thinking goes.

While stupid+damaged+unskilled sounds harsh written out, recognize that this is the most common narrative people use internally to explain any large differences in opinion. Many use softer abstractions like “cycle of violence,” “religious fundamentalist,” “elites,” “immature,” “inexperienced,” “Stockholm syndrome,” or “uneducated” to avoid sounding like they feel superior, but this is usually a lie. These are just possible explanations for *why* the other person is bad at thinking. If someone uses them, their core (implicit) assessment is still that the other person is stupid, damaged, and/or unskilled at thinking.

# The Data

I have met people who don’t care about being insulted or devalued. They seem to think of such actions as moves in a game where the winner gets what they want. While my dataset of such people is not statistically meaningful, those people have also struck me as generally apathetic to the value of other people, that what happens to others is not their problem. Within my life, the frequency of such people is between 1 in 20 and 1 in 50.

I have met many people who, when insulted or called out on it, expend great effort to avoid talking about that experience. This can extend to other people adjacent to the insult, who can apply great effort just to prevent two people from talking about it with each other.

People in the Midwest tend to do this, especially in Minnesota. I believe this to be a byproduct of that culture’s fear of conflict, because the conflict inherent in such a discussion is more painful than the insult itself.

Such efforts can even be disrespectful or dehumanizing. I’ve seen people apply false equivalence in order to keep peace between a reasonable party and a malicious party.

# Fallacies

For more, see the discussion in [False equivalence, etc](https://github.com/dylannevans/faith/blob/core/False%20equivalence.md).

## Assume positive intent

Many people have relationship problems because they attribute opposition as malice. “You’re either for or against me” is the most common way you hear that perspective.

Recommending that everyone “assumes positive intent” as a general operating rule makes sense: it’s a method of shifting many people’s default tendency to assume malice back toward reasonableness.

It is still a fallacy because there are people with bad intent, and the evidence indicating it is available if you are thoughtful and observant.

I believe that misconceived intent is the *root cause* of most conflict, frustration, and nonideal outcomes. Addressing someone’s priorities is the best way to work with them. This can be challenging because people often hide or lie about their goals, even to themselves. Part of the challenge of finding a common solution is correctly discerning someone’s true priorities. Lying to yourself about someone’s intent, even if it is to give them “the benefit of the doubt”, is counterproductive to that goal.

A better approach is to advocate “never assume intent.” This has the added benefit of allowing for more truth – very few people’s true intent falls strictly into bad or good. Most frequently people have a mix of priorities, and very few people rigorously examine themselves well enough to know the drivers of their own behavior.

## Good and Bad intent

With a couple exceptions, there’s no such thing as good and bad intent. To begin with, it is fuzzily defined. Let’s start with what most people mean by the terms. Someone with good intent cares about your wellbeing. If they have bad intent, they do not.

Even upon initial description, dividing people into good and bad intent is problematic. People’s underlying priorities are almost never focused on you, so almost nobody will fall into those buckets.

Here’s a short list of underlying priorities I have noticed in people, with full descriptions in Appendix A:

-   Fear
-   Power
-   Schadenfreude
-   Value
-   Pleasure
-   Truth

These can manifest in different ways. Some can be focused internally or externally, and frequently people settle for self-deception instead of actual satisfaction of their goal.

I believe that all people exhibit at least a little of each of these categories, but that different people focus on some or others more, and in different ways. I suspect most people are roughly balanced between these categories, and those strongly focused on only some seem unbalanced or weird.

The success of a relationship will depend on how you can satisfy their priorities while still meeting your own.

## Assuming

There are analogous prohibitions on assuming anything. By most definitions, “assume” means to conclude without adequate data. Many people selectively extend this to absurdity, calling any unfavorable conclusions assumptions. Because complete information is never available, it is inadequate, and thus any conclusion is an assumption and forbidden. Usually, this logic is implicit, and people jump straight to labelling a conclusion as an assumption, and letting people’s associations with assumptions do the rest. This criticism is usually used to dishonestly cast doubt on accuracy without engaging with the idea itself.

This rhetoric depends on an unexamined lie, reducing human perception to a false (and unattainable) binary: that each claim about the world is completely baseless or completely substantiable. As people, we live in a world of partial truths, and to function, we need to make decisions about the world around us with that incomplete data. A better model is to ascribe confidence to a particular conclusion, and a rule of openness to learning new information that may change it.

For instance, if you planned to meet a new acquaintance for coffee and they miss it, you now have one data point about them. Because of general knowledge about social norms, you know that missing a meeting is infrequent among people with reliable personal organization habits, so you may conclude that they may be less reliable than average. However, there are many other possible explanations: a semi may have bonked them on the way there, they may have had a hard time finding the keys because their kid hid them under the couch, and they may have found something better to do and you weren’t important enough to update. Your conclusion is valid but weak. If you continue to reschedule with this person and they continually skip it, that will give your conclusion much greater strength.

With people who frequently make the conclusion -\> assumption substitution, I sometimes use the word “interpretation” to help remind them that all conclusions are based on data and I recognize the its incompleteness. Many people enthusiastic about this idea self-identify with the phrase, “strong opinions, held weakly” to indicate their willingness to change their conclusions given persuasive data.

## My realization

There are a lot of problems with this model, but one of the most important is that people truly do have different priorities. If someone’s priority is power and your wellbeing doesn’t support that goal, no amount of “talking it out” will clarify their malicious actions to just be mistakes or miscommunications. At worst, talking it out might push you further down an incorrect path – they might lie to you, possibly telling you what you want to hear and letting you delude yourself into thinking the problem solved.

This finally broke in June 2017 when I was overcome with overwhelming evidence that my wellbeing was immaterial to someone I knew. I knew this person well enough that all possibility of my previous model was eliminated: the only remaining possibility was that they just didn’t care about me. This contradicted what I had been taught; because no amount of talking would resolve that difference of intent.

I began a journey to eliminate my assumption of positive intent. In order, I learned several things about myself:

-   I find it scary and demoralizing to collaborate with people whose motives I must second-guess.
-   I do not have many tools to work with people who do not value me.
-   I trust people who are authentic. If someone only tells you pleasant things, they are lying, at least by omission.
-   It is difficult for me to create compelling value propositions because it is difficult to imagine what others care about.

## I am a judger

I also realized that I judge priorities. I am gracious and understanding of life situations. I’ve become fairly forgiving of failure, even continued failure, focusing on growth and learning. However, I have no patience for wrong priorities, and I judge a person’s moral status and value to society by their priorities.

In this way, I am deeply self-centered. I do not and cannot conceive of a mindset with different priorities. What would it be like to not care about truth or the value I bring to the world, and instead have fear or a desire for pleasure drive my decisions? I cannot begin to realistic conceive of how that would affect my daily life.

I think this trait is rare – many people are find it easy to step into someone else’s priorities; I think this is one of the defining skills of great salespeople.

I am strongly biased toward Value, then Truth, then some residual to Pleasure. I despise people who are weighted toward other priorities and respect people who align to my own priorities. I’m not sure if this is immoral, but I do know my priorities are not something I can take credit for.

I find my judgement problematic. There are people in my life who prioritize pleasure and fear, and I love them. I am deeply invested in their wellbeing. I don’t think they deserve blame for their status. How can I love them effectively?

## The practical

This shows up in ways unpredictable to others. It causes me discomfort when other people believe wrong things and deep discomfort when other people believe wrong things about me. Misalignment with those I work or collaborate with is a table-stakes problem for me. Some of my most painful moments have been in second-guessing someone’s intent – it feels like an unsolveable maze of unproductive thought.

I interpret disrespect when someone lies to me, especially when it’s a bad lie. For instance, if someone dismisses my carefully considered conclusions with a flat dismissal, that’s a clear indication that they don’t see value in convincing me; and therefore they see no value in my mind or ideas. If someone tells me something that is clearly false, it is clear that they care so little about my right or ability to think for myself that they think they can end my line of thinking with the 3 seconds it takes to say ‘nu-uh”.

If the core of being human is agency and the ability to consider information, think, and make decisions, a bad lie dehumanizes. Truth, especially hard truth, honors that humanity.

I see dishonesty as the root cause of most of the evil in the world: “they have exchanged the truth for a lie.” I feel I have a moral duty to address it when it comes up around me. I temper this with a rule for myself about never volunteering my thoughts, only providing them when asked. This avoids wasted time and me sounding like a jerk when others aren’t interested – influence is a precious resource. As a moral principle, I will not lie to people, even when they ask me to. I have only recently adopted this priority over the last 10 years and I haven’t fully changed my habits to reflect it. I sometimes still tell people what they want to hear in times of stress, especially lies of omission.

## My mission

A successful salesperson recently told me that people primarily buy from someone they like, and secondarily from someone they trust. Within my worldview, these are identical – I like people because I trust them. But separating them explains that most people’s criteria for “like” is different than “trust”, and of the two, “like” is more important. To win friends and influence people, you must figure out how to make them like you. I believe this is by delivering their priorities.

In the last year, I’ve been given some good tools for discerning intent and working with people who have different priorities – Never Split the Difference, The Mom Test, The Road to You, and via conversations. I now have more tools than I did in 2020 when this issue first crested for me.

Some of my activities seem to indicate priorities that are not important for me. For instance, I am focused on a project that requires me to sell. Caring about sales skills and outcomes is often associated with Power, but to me, getting influence or money is just a side-effect to my underlying goal: delivering Value. Because being misunderstood incurs discomfort, I spend some angst on appearing to care about Power.

My personal ethical boundaries prohibit me from the easiest way to make people like me: lying to them. If I am unable to meaningfully perceive what it would be like to have someone else’s priorities, what methods will be most effective to me in collaborating with them?

# Open questions

Are some priorities moral and others immoral?

Are some ways of following a priority more “moral” than others?

What are the most effective practices to become better at discerning intent?

# Appendix A: Priorities explained
## Fear

Fear drives many people. It can be obvious, like worrying about absurd situations such as lightning strikes or ax murderers. Fear can be more subtle, like being so afraid of rejection that you’d rather dump someone before they can have a chance to dump you. Fear of failure can be a powerful force in helping someone achieve their goals. Some people fear being truly known, such as in imposter syndrome or the tendency of people on facebook to feel deficient because they only see the carefully curated highlight reel of success from the people around them. Guilt and shame are just fear of discovery about a particular way you often fail. Fear can manifest as malice, “the best defence is a good offence.” Fear drives many to stockpile money or other tangible goods. Fear of divine retribution can drive people to acts of mercy, generosity, or piousness. Fear can push people to escapism like gambling, video games, or alcoholism. Fear of disappointing or hurting those they love can drive them to abstain. Often this priority is mixed with power.

## Power

Some people want more power. Power to be in control. Sometimes this looks like interpersonal control over other people – being influential to many, or even being manipulative or abusive. Sometimes this control is over the self – control over urges of the body like hunger or pain. Sometimes the control manifests tangibly as money or authority. Often power can be mixed with fear: the desire to be in control and the fear of being subject to the unpredictable can be indistinguishable.

Relevant Quote:

Sometimes people use “respect” to mean “treating someone like a person” and sometimes they mean “respect” to mean “treating someone like an authority”

and sometimes people who are used to being treated like an authority say “if you won’t respect me I won’t respect you” and they mean “if you won’t treat me like an authority I won’t treat you like a person”

and they think they’re being fair but they aren’t.

## Schadenfreude

The adopted german word for “happiness at the misfortune of others”, this encompasses revenge and hate, where the true goal is someone’s downfall or pain. The only true malicious intent. You see small examples of this in America’s Funniest Videos and tabloid celebrity scandal stories. Larger ones usually show up tribal pep talks, such as “stick it to the libs” or “the only good X is a dead X.” Sometimes this priority is mixed with fear and power.

## Value

Many people want to be valuable. They want to be productive and important and see that through their effort, good things happened. Sometimes people define their value through metrics –volunteer hours or season RBIs or gross revenue. Sometimes people define their value through the opinions and feedback of the people around them.

People for whom value is a priority are often bothered by the disrespect of others because insults are an indication that someone does not find them valuable.

Often people who prioritize value tell themselves deep lies about their value and competence to preserve a preferred self-perception. Contrary indications are seen as attacks and warrant extreme denials or counterattacks.

Some people interested in value define it comparatively: their value is how much more valuable they are than the people around them. People with this perspective often try to reduce the perceived value of others, either through words or sabotage.

## Pleasure

People who prioritize pleasure try to increase the enjoyable things in their life and reduce the undesirable ones. For some, this can look like skiing or parties or meditation or petting a cat. It can also appear as avoiding work, chores, difficult decisions, or hard conversations.

People who focus on pleasure and value often care about whether a situation is fair. Those more focused on pleasure usually invoke it for themselves, and those who care about value invoke it for others. Such people are also often the most competitive. People with comparative drives for value want to demonstrate their superiority over others, even if the prize for winning is nominal. People who are more focused on pleasure are most competitive when the prize is large.

Sometimes, pursuing pleasure can appear apathetic or malicious.

## Truth

“Starting with a different set of facts” can lead to differences of opinion. But facts are facts. When you ask someone about how they got their facts, you’ll get to one of two answers:

-   they’ll start talking about fact-verification processes and statistics and hows and levels of confidence and Occam’s razor.
-   They’ll express apathy to all that. Sometimes they’ll say, “that’s how I was raised,” or “it’s just what I believe” or some indication that facts believed are a byproduct of circumstance.

Someone who answer in the first way believes in objective truth and sees it as a goal – primarily for themselves, and secondarily to educate or correct in others.

The second perspective does not find truth important, either because they do not believe in truth as a concept, or because whether something is true is not as important as other aspects about it. Such people often see truth as another rhetoric device – equally useful as exaggeration or an appeal to authority. Most importantly, truth is only useful in pursuit of something they do find important. Such people use the word “truth” loosely, usually meaning “something I feel strongly about.”

*Note*: sometimes you can get a false read on people. For example, people who find truth important may still respond the second way to avoid a conversation about that fact.

People who value truth find hypocrisy upsetting.
