Kaizen, Personal Growth, Science, and Sanctification are all domain-specific words for the same concept: continuously improvement. Becoming better relies on two activities performed cyclically: trying and reflecting. Trying to do something new or in a new way helps grow you because it rarely goes completely the way you expect. In other words, it will almost always result in failure such that failure := a nonideal outcome. Reflection on the failure, its root causes, and its mechanisms of action yields a practical gap between your expectation and reality. Closing the gap by adjusting your expectations or approach is where the cycle yields value: you have learned something. The cycle then repeats with you trying again, fully expecting and hoping to fail and learn and fail and learn and fail and learn, eventually becoming far better than you could ever conceive of. 

What more could you hope for?

What are our jobs and houses and cars and boats and vacations and romance and friends but a larger version of a playground of sandboxes and toy trucks for toddlers? All the castles and balls and dolls are ephemeral, moved and changed by the next kids to come to the playground, and reset each evening by adults, wind, and rain. Toddlers sometimes think that their work is important, and extreme emotions can arise from conflicts between them about how the dolls hair needs to look or what kind of sand castle is built. 
The point of the playground is not that the toy trucks get driven or that the sand gets shaped correctly. No: the playground gives the toddlers opportunities to learn and grow. That is why it was built and that is why parents bring their kids there.

You have an advantage that toddlers do not: they are still half-animal, always and only doing the first thing that comes into their head. For them, there is only the Now. Because of your past growth, you know that you can pause and consider and decide. You understand that there is more than just the Now: there is a next time, too. You can direct and accelerate your growth. 

All the trucks and dolls and other kids you are focused on could be gone tomorrow. The most enduring and important part of the playground is you and who you are becoming. 

Don’t waste your failures. Don’t run away from effort or pain or hard truths or discomfort. Close the gap. Grow. You are worth it.
