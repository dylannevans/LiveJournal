# Intro

These words represent my best attempt at summarizing the most important ideas about my faith, and I suspect orthodox Christianity in general. It focuses on the "Why" and "How", and less on "What." There are three versions: Long (700 words), Medium (200 words), and Short (100 words). See Appendix A for design considerations.

## Top questions

How closely does this match your understanding of the most important tenets of your faith?

Which of these ideas is least important? Do the Short and Medium versions focus on the right topics?

# Long

## My failure

**I am a sinner**. I regularly and consistently fail God by ignoring him, distracting myself from what he tells me, and seeking easy paths or short-term pleasure. I do not have the knowledge and wisdom to know what is good for me, and most of the time I ignore God&#39;s suggestion I am dissatisfied and disappointed.

**I lie to myself**. I blame others for my failures. I try to distract myself from my inadequacy. I think I deserve pleasure and resent God&#39;s direction. I credit good circumstance and God&#39;s blessings to my own virtue. I focus on easy unhelpful things instead of hard, good things.

**I am a hypocrite**. I think I&#39;m pretty great. I am impatient with the failures of others; I judge myself by my intent and others by their actions. I try to impress and please others.

**I am selfish**. I prioritize my pleasure and convenience. I resent the failures and wrongness of others. I ignore opportunities to love those around me.

**I am afraid.** I fear feeling incompetent, being taken advantage of, feeling worthless, and wasting my time. I avoid that fear by trying to control people and situations. 

**I seek idols**. I deceive myself that achievement, other&#39;s positive perceptions, and correctness justifies my worth. I seek immersive distractions from my failure and shame. I worry about things I can&#39;t change, and I get stuck reliving fear, anger, and hurt.

**I continue to choose sin**. I take God and everything he&#39;s done for granted.

## My life

**A broken world**. I live where selfishness and malice yield fortune and respect. Failure, stupidity, pain, ignorance, and death are everywhere. I hate it but see how it reminds us of our need for God.

**God loves me**. He continues to love me; so much that he sacrificed himself, his only son to save me. He has shown that he wants good things from me. There is nothing I can do to merit his attention or respect. He chooses to value and love me. 

**God knows my continual sin**. He knows how I continue to reject him, his direction, and his love. He sees past my failure to the perfect design that he will someday restore me and the world to.

**God wants better things for me than I do.** God teaches me things about myself and the world. God&#39;s plan for me ends up better in ways I never conceived until they are realized. I believe God when he promises a final end to suffering, evil, selfishness, and stupidity.

## My need

I need help. I accept God&#39;s offer of love and direction. I want God to be close to me, be loud in my life, and overwhelm me. I look forward to being part of God&#39;s plan. I want to see the things he&#39;s promised come true.

## My response

With God&#39;s help,

**I will love God**. I will be humble and happy to help with the roles and tasks he asks. I will seek an uncomplicated attitude, happy to be with God and eager to help however he asks.

**I will love people**. Through my words and actions, I will persuade people around me that they have great value, are worth loving, and are capable of creating good. I will be generous with my time and resources. I will respect people and the worth God puts in them, the traits God gives them, and the opportunities and challenges God sets before them. I will support everyone in growth towards God.

**I will grow**. I will apply effort toward the lessons He presents. I will follow God&#39;s direction with gratitude and humility, even if they aren&#39;t fun. I will not fall into defensiveness, blame, helplessness, or self-deception about my failures; I will appreciate His ongoing investment in me. In slow periods, I will embrace rest. In periods of activity, I will embrace work.

**I will reject fear**. I will trust God and his path. I will follow directions when &quot;failure&quot; seems certain. 

**I will reject the world&#39;s corrupting influence**. I will notice lies and evil within myself, those around me, and the systems I participate in. I will address them strategically and productively.

**I will stay focused on God&#39;s priorities**. I will follow his words for me in the Bible, from those around me He inspires, and through prayer.

# Medium

I am a sinner living in a broken world. I regularly and consistently fail God by ignoring him. I lie to myself. I try to distract myself from my inadequacy by focusing on easy unhelpful things instead of hard, good things. I am a selfish hypocrite and do not know what is good for me. I try to justify myself, and I take God for granted. I continue to choose sin.

Only God can save me. He continues to love me, and so much that he sacrificed himself. There is nothing I can do to deserve his attention or respect: he chooses to place worth on me and love me. I know I should honor that decision and follow his example. I will listen to and trust God. I believe in the future he promised.

I will love God with everything; following his direction and staying focused on his priorities. I will honor his sacrifice, and so love myself and the people around me. I will address the lies around me strategically and productively. I will try again when I fail.

I need God and want him to be big in my life.

# Short

I am a sinner. I do not know what is good for me and ignore God&#39;s direction. I lie to myself, I try to justify myself, and I take God for granted.

God knows my sin and sacrificed his only son to save me from it. He chooses to love me; I will honor that decision.

With God&#39;s help, I will follow his direction. I will love him. Through my words and actions, I will persuade people that they have great value, are worth loving, and are capable of good.

I will listen and follow Jesus&#39; direction for my life.

**Failure** : a non-ideal outcome.

## Context

There are many other truths that complement or even naturally follow from the statements in these creeds or complement them. Examples: triune God, original sin, which [parts of an animal have fat](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=leviticus+7%3A3-4&amp;version=NIV). In reading Jesus&#39; words via the synoptic gospels, it is clear that he had priorities for us – some commandments/lessons/ideas/truths are more important to God than others. This [came up explicitly](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+10%3A25-28&amp;version=NIV), and also clear every time Jesus answered questions: [he didn&#39;t give them the easy](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+15%3A1-20&amp;version=NIV) and [useless answers they wanted](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+19%3A1-8&amp;version=NIV), [he told them what](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+12%3A22-45&amp;version=NIV) he [wanted them to know](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2010%3A25-37&amp;version=NIV). My interpretation of [his judgement on the Pharisees](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+11%3A37-54&amp;version=NIV) was precisely this: they had distracted themselves from the hard and worthwhile worship of God, [replacing it with the easy-but-useless activities](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+5%3A36-47&amp;version=NIV) of arguing theology and practicing legalism with [hard hearts](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+12%3A1-13&amp;version=NIV). [Even OT](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=hosea+6%3A4-9&amp;version=NIV)[thought leaders](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm+51%3A10-17&amp;version=NIV) had an inkling that this wasn&#39;t gonna work too well and [the burnt offerings](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=hebrews+10%3A4-10&amp;version=NIV) of their lives [smelled bad to God](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=isaiah+1%3A10-15&amp;version=NIV). One of Jesus&#39; most surprising themes was that the Israelite&#39;s legalistic desire to be justified by works wasn&#39;t getting them anywhere. [Paul said it well](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=phillipians+3%3A4-9&amp;version=NIV) here (and in Romans too)

We have had the same temptation since: legalism is a tempting idea, and arguing theology is a wonderful distraction from the more important idea that you&#39;re pathetic and need a savior _now_. How many councils have there been about distinctions that Jesus didn&#39;t think worthwhile to discuss? All the ones I know of.

### Modern-day example

Which is a more dangerous heresy: [Arianism](http://www.ellenwhiteanswers.org/answers/mischarges/arianism/) or Prosperity Gospel? I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s the latter with evidence from the Man himself: Which did Jesus seem more intent on clearly explaining: [rich people and their relationship to God](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+19%3A16-30&amp;version=NIV), or the exact mechanics of [his relationship](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+14%3A15-31&amp;version=NIV) with God and the Holy Spirit?

## Content Decisions

I decided not to include any context – God&#39;s nature, the history of God&#39;s actions, human nature, the fall. If the goal of a creed is to succinctly summarize the most important ideas in Christianity as clearly and effectively as possible, those don&#39;t make the cut. They are supporting details. How we got to this point is _less_ important than what we do now.

### Some passages that cause me and this approach difficulty:

- [Ye Olde Fulfillment of the Law quote](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5%3A17-20&amp;version=NIV). I feel somewhat ok about this: The law is true, but keeping the law without love for God is empty. Also see Romans 2:17-20, especially the NT Wright translation of the last clause in 20: &quot;all because, in the law, you possess the outline of the knowledge and truth.&quot; [James also comes to mind](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=james+2%3A14-26&amp;version=NIV): works are a natural expression of faith. Still: If I could have lunch with Jesus, I&#39;d ask him about this quote. I&#39;d ask about how he sees it relating to touching unclean people, the de-forbidding of pig meat, and what Paul said to the Ephesians about circumcision. Honestly, he&#39;d probably say &quot;don&#39;t worry about it.&quot;
- John has a lot of [abstract poetic discourse](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+14%3A15-31&amp;version=NIV) that [I&#39;ve seen people cite](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+6%3A25-59&amp;version=NIV) when discussing the mechanics of God. When I read these, I still hear focus from Jesus on the things in my creed – the Holy Spirit is more of an aside than his main point.

## Design decisions

### Accessible

I am trying to write for the broadest audience possible. If God wants his truth spread to everyone because they are worth it, I should generally should shoot for the lowest barrier possible for people to understand what I mean. This means avoiding big words, and especially words that are unique to Christian culture. A good example would be &quot;catholic&quot; in the Apostle&#39;s. If your word choice confuses so many people that you need a footnote with a translation, you should just choose a different word.

I am also trying to use phrasing and cadences that cause readers the least friction. Often Christian writing (including the bible) uses archaic sentence structure or complicated phrasing. This makes it hard to read and understand. I think it still could be a lot better in this area.

### Minimalist design philosophy

I ascribe to the idea that [often the best way](https://creativemarket.com/blog/minimalist-design-trend) to make something easier to use or understand is not by adding to it, but by taking away everything you can without compromising the essential function or message. What is most essential about Christianity and God&#39;s message to us? John 3:16? Micah 6:8? The Shema + Lev 19:18? It seems obvious to me when reading the Bible that God has priorities for us, and it frustrates me how often Christian writing and teaching focuses on ideas or principles that may be true but are a low priority to God. In particular, I see a lot of evil arise from that kind of disconnect, and I see writing this creed as a necessary grounding step on my path toward being able to address it.
